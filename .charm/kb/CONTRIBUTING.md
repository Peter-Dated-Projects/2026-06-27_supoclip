# Contributing to the Knowledge Base

This is a **durable** knowledge base -- it survives between charm runs and across sessions.
Keep it accurate: a note the next agent trusts but that lies is worse than no note at all.

## How to add a note

1. Pick the right root: `architecture`, `decisions`, `conventions`, `gotchas`, `domain`,
   or `tracks/<name>` (see below).
   Only add a new root directory if nothing genuinely fits -- and if you do, give it an
   `_index.md` and add a row to `INDEX.md`.
2. Write **one concept per note** (atomic). Filename is lowercase-kebab (`spawn-model.md`);
   decisions use a zero-padded numeric prefix (`0001-single-git-tree.md`).
3. Add the frontmatter below. `summary` is the most important field -- one self-contained
   sentence a reader can judge *without opening the note*.
4. Add a row for the note in that root's `_index.md`, and bump the count in `INDEX.md`.

## Frontmatter schema

```yaml
---
id: <kebab-slug>          # matches the filename without .md
root: architecture        # architecture | decisions | conventions | gotchas | domain
type: architecture | decision | convention | gotcha | domain
status: current | stale | superseded
summary: "One self-contained sentence -- the navigation surface."
related:                  # KB-relative paths, no .md extension; optional
  - decisions/0001-single-git-tree
created: YYYY-MM-DD        # set once, immutable
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

## Updating notes

- Reversed a decision? Set the old note to `status: superseded`, point its `related` at the
  replacement -- do **not** delete it (keep the audit trail).
- Suspect a note is out of date but haven't reverified? Mark it `status: stale`.
- Any edit: bump `updated`.

## Links

Use ordinary markdown relative links in note bodies, and KB-relative paths in `related`.
Not Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` -- this KB is read with file tools, not a graph UI.

## Track notes (`tracks/<name>/`)

Some lines of work live on their own git branch (worktrees) and produce notes that only
make sense in that context -- research output, scratchpad, in-progress ideas, or
track-specific design decisions that would clutter the shared KB.

Use `tracks/<name>/` for these. Convention:

- `<name>` matches the worktree name (e.g. `tracks/native-ui/`, `tracks/go-rewrite/`).
- Each track directory gets an `INDEX.md` listing what is there and a one-line description
  of the track's goal.
- Frontmatter is optional here -- scratchpad format is fine.
- Notes that turn out to be durable and cross-cutting should be promoted to one of the
  shared roots (architecture, decisions, etc.) and removed from the track folder.

Track notes live on the worktree's branch, not on main. The shared KB roots are
branch-agnostic; track notes are branch-specific.

## Navigation (how the KB is meant to be read)

Read `INDEX.md` -> the relevant root's `_index.md` -> only the 1-2 notes whose summary
matches the task. Never bulk-read the KB. If you can't find what you need from summaries,
the summaries need fixing.
